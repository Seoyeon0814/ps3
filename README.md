# Problem Set 3:
# This should be turned in as a public github repository (for this each person will create their own repository rather than using GitHub Classrooms) with your code either in Python scripts or Jupyter Notebooks.

# You may work on this in groups or on your own. If you work as a group, you should create the group in Canvas so that you are not assigned to review another submission from your group.

# Even if you work in groups, each person must submit the assignment in Canvas for the peer review process to work.

# Note: This assignment will have peer review. It is important to be able to look at someone else's code and figure out what they are doing. It's also important to write code with the idea that someone else will look at it and needs to understand it. While I will take both the peer reviewer's comments on your code and your comments on the peer reviewed code into account when assigning grades, I will be assigning the grade, not the reviewer.
